			I am the Research Software Engineering Capability Lead at the British Geologial Survey.
			In the RSE spectrum, I began at 100% "writes papers" then increasingly used code for my science.
			After leaving academia,  I went all the way to 100% "writes code" and now sit at about 95% "writes code".

			Hands up who came from 100% papers?  Hands up for 100% code?

			I noticed that 100% coders all learned about databases, but those coming from 100% papers didn't.
			This talk is aimed at me from 15 years ago, to introduce me to the benefits.

			I hope that there is something for everyone - an intro to SQL for those to whom it is new, and
			a tour of some useful tools for those who aren't.

		<h2>Databases and SQLite</h2>
		<aside data-markdown class="notes">
			+ The first part of the talk introduces databases and SQLite.
			+ I'm specifically referring to relational database management systems e.g. the kind
			with tables that you interact with via SQL.
			+ I'll also demonstrate SQLite Browser software.
		</aside>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>Databases power applications</h3>
		<img class="r-stretch" src="images/switch_website.png">
		<aside data-markdown class="notes">
			+ At their simplest, databases are places to store tables of data for fast retrieval.
            + You can see them in action on most websites e.g. here where I'm searching for a second-hand Nintendo Switch for under Â£200
			+ https://uk.webuy.com/search?stext=nintendo+switch&availability=In+Stock+Online&categoryFriendlyName=Switch+Consoles&sellPrice=:200&Condition=Unboxed~Discounted&Model+Name=Switch
			+ All computer scientists taught about them.
			+ They are back-end technology and you generally interact with them via programming, so they are off the radar of non-coders.

		<h3>Excel is not a database</h3>
		<img class="r-stretch" src="images/excel_gene_renaming.png">
		<aside data-markdown class="notes">
			Instead, many researchers use Excel to handle tables of data.
			It has a convenient interface to edit tables BUT
			+ Mixes formatting with content
			+ Code is hidden
			+ Sorting defaults to individual column
			+ Auto-complete changes data
			https://theconversation.com/excel-autocorrect-errors-still-plague-genetic-research-raising-concerns-over-scientific-rigour-166554
			+ Recent increase in scientists using Python / R for analysis is helping the move away from Excel

		<h3>The most popular database in the world is</h3>
		<img class="center" src="images/SQLite370.svg", height="350">
		<aside data-markdown class="notes">
			+ The claim that you are never more than 2 m from a rat isn't true, but you are never far from a SQLite database - over 1 trillion have been deployed
			+ In every smart phone, contact list, browser history, iTunes library, fitness tracker data

			+ SQLite provides a standalone single file database with full access to the SQL language
			+ Similar local file to MS Access or LibreOffice base, but still a backend technology without GUI and designed to be interoperable

			+ PostgreSQL is a popular, open-source server-based database.
			+ Like "full-fat" databases such as Oracle and MS-SQL is is based on a central server.
			+ Server systems have transactions and lock mechanisms to handle thousands of concurrent users.
			+ Using SQLite on a network drive is not recommended; use PostgreSQL if you need concurrent edits
			+ Both SQLite and PostgreSQL can handle JSON, allowing unstructured data processing without
			  NoSQL databases.
			+ SQLite also lacks type enforcement and user-generate functions, although if you interact via
			  code then the code can provide those.

		<h3>DB Browser for SQLite</h3>
		<video class="r-stretch" controls src="images/db_browser_tour.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
		<aside data-markdown class="notes">
		  + Having said that, a GUI front end for SQLite is very useful and these have come a long way in the past decade.
		  + I recommend DbBrowser for SQLite, which is a fully-featured, open-source GUI front-end for SQLite.
		  + The video gives a short tour.
		</aside>

		<h2>Introduction to SQL</h2>
		<aside data-markdown class="notes">
			+ SQL stands for structured query language.
			+ Originally from 70s, but developed a standard in 1980s.
			+ It is used to query relational database management systems.
			+ Data are queried far more frequently than they are written and it is SQL that gives the RDBMSs their power.

			In this section, I'll demonstrate some SQL queries.
			I'll pause for a few seconds before showing two of them - those of you who know SQL can
			compose a query in your head and see if you were correct.
		</aside>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>SELECT extracts data</h3>
		<img class="r-stretch" src="images/volcano_01_select.png">
		<aside data-markdown class="notes">
			+ The following queries were run against the database used in the Db Browser
			+ The simplest SQL query is SELECT * FROM table, which returns all the rows
			+ This is the same as the table view in the DbBrowser tools

			+ For a more complex query, I want to find out the top 10 tallest volcanoes in Iceland
			+ I'll give you a few seconds to think about the query
		</aside>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>Filters and sorting</h3>
		<img class="r-stretch" src="images/volcano_02_filter.png">
		<aside data-markdown class="notes">
			+ The tallest volcano is Oraefajokull, at 2010 m.
			+ The results show that we have specified some columns, filtered with WHERE,
			  ordered the results and limited them.
			+ You can see that SQL is easy to understand.
			+ You can also imagine how a similar query would power the search for
			  a Nintendo Switch on the website
		</aside>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>JOIN combines tables</h3>
		<img class="r-stretch" src="images/volcano_03_join.png">
		<aside data-markdown class="notes">
			+ SQL also has the concept of a JOIN, where you can combine data from different
			  tables based on a column with shared values.
			+ This join here uses the country name to join the volcanoes with the population data.
			+ Now that we have volcanoes and population, we can ask which countries have the most
			  volcanoes per person.
			
			+ If you know SQL, I'll give you a few seconds to think about the query.
			+ Also, think about what the result will be and what the top 10 countries will have
			  in common.
		</aside>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>GROUP BY aggregates values</h3>
		<img class="r-stretch" src="images/volcano_04_group_by.png">
		<aside data-markdown class="notes">
			+ And the winner is Tonga, with one volcano per 5,000 inhabitants.
			+ Newcastle University has 28k students - if it had the same ratio is Tonga it
			  would also have 5 volcanoes!
			+ All the top countries are (volcanic) island nations.

			+ This query uses GROUP BY, which allows you to use aggregate functions.
			+ COUNT and AVG operate on the groups of all rows for a given country.
			+ Pandas has a similar concept.
			+ We can also do calculations in the query, such as the calculation of
			  "volcanoes_per_person"
			+ Note that because this query was written as code we can store it in version
			  control and re-run it easily, making the analysis reproducible.
		</aside>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>VIEWs store pre-defined queries</h3>
		<img class="r-stretch" src="images/volcano_05_view.png">
		<aside data-markdown class="notes">
			+ Finally, the database allows us to create views that reuse other queries.
			+ Now, instead of having to type the full query again, we can use
			  SELECT * FROM volcanoes_per_person and run the query again.

		<h2>Useful tools</h2>
		<aside data-markdown class="notes">
			+ In the finaly section of the talk, I want to tell you about 3 tools
			  that I find very useful for working with SQLite.
			+ Hopefully even people from database backgrounds will find something useful
			  here.
			+ The tools are QGIS for making data entry forms, Datasette for publishing
			  data over the web and ETL Helper to simplify using databases with Python.
		</aside>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>QGIS has nice forms...</h3>
		<video class="r-stretch" controls src="images/qgis_widgets_h264.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
		<aside data-markdown class="notes">
			+ QGIS stands for Quantum GIS; it is an open-source geographic information
			  systems tool based on the Qt GUI library.
			+ A large part of GIS is relational databases, but rows can have a geometry
			  attached that corresponds to a point, line or location on the map.
			+ QGIS was initially written as a front-end to PostGIS (spatial PostgreSQL) and
			  can connect to other databases, too.
			+ The geopackage data format, which is a replacement for shape files, is actually
			  a SQLite database with a specific structure.
			+ This video shows how QGIS lets you create nice forms for data entry.

		<h3>...and understands relationships...</h3>
		<pre data-id="code-animation">
			<code class="hljs sql" data-line-numbers="2,5|10,12,16">
CREATE TABLE "H3H4_in_soil" (
	"fid" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
	"geometry" POINT,
	"locality" TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
	"thickness" REAL,
	"notes" TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE "photos" (
	"fid" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
	"locality_id" TEXT,
	"file_path" TEXT,
	"notebook" BOOLEAN,
	"notes" TEXT,
	FOREIGN KEY("locality_id") REFERENCES "H3H4_in_soil"("locality")
);
		    </code>
		</pre>
		<aside data-markdown class="notes">
			+ In this example we create two tables, one of localities and another for photos.
			+ The locality table has a "point" geometry that can be plotted on a map.
			+ We use a foreign key reference to link the tables.
			+ This enforces the relationship by preventing us making an entry in the
			  photos table that doesn't have a corresponding locality.
			+ This is the R in RDBMS.
		</aside>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>...and understands relationships...</h3>
		<img class="r-stretch" src="images/hekla_relation_widget.png">
		<aside data-markdown class="notes">
			+ QGIS is able to detect the relationship and offers a Relation reference
			  widget that allows you to manage child tables (e.g. photos) from within
			  the "parent" table (e.g. the locality table).
		</aside>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>...to give an efficient interface</h3>
		<video class="r-stretch" controls src="images/photo_form_demo.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
		<aside data-markdown class="notes">
			+ This interface allows us to browse the map and see the measurements at
			  each locality.
			+ We can also see the photos for each locality in the same form.
		</aside>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>Datasette publishes data to the web...</h3>
		<img class="r-stretch" src="images/datasette_landing_page.png">
		<aside data-markdown class="notes">
			+ Datasette is a tool for publishing SQLite databases online.
			+ It spins up a web service with an HTML front-end that provides read-only
			  access to the database.
			+ The most powerful feature is that you can run arbitrary queries
			  including JOINS and GROUP BY.
			+ Here you can see the volcano.db file being served by Datasette.
		</aside>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>...with sorting, filters and queries...</h3>
		<img class="r-stretch" src="images/datasette_web_query.png">
		<aside data-markdown class="notes">
			+ The web interface has GUI options for filtering and sorting.
			+ The resulting query is stored within the URL, meaning that it
			  can be shared as a link.
		</aside>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>...and an API for JSON and CSV</h3>
		<img class="r-stretch" src="images/datasette_json_query.png">
		<aside data-markdown class="notes">
			+ The results can also be returned as JSON or CSV.
			+ Here you can see the SELECT * FROM volcano WHERE name IS "Hekla"
			  query.
			+ All the data are represented in the JSON.
			+ API access allows Datasette to act as a "glue" between different processes.
			+ For example, we have a Python script to query vSphere for a list of VMs that
			  is published to Datasette.  Another script queries the API for the list and
			  uses it to generate an inventory of servers for Prometheus to target for
			  monitoring.
		</aside>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>ETL Helper simplifies data access...</h3>
		<img class="r-stretch" src="images/etlhelper_github.png">
		<aside data-markdown class="notes">
			+ The final tool that I want to demonstrate is ETL Helper.
			+ This is a library that we have written within BGS to simplify database
			  tasks (including SQLite, Oracle, PostgreSQL) in Python scripts.  You can
			  see the description here.
			+ Python has sqlite3 in standard library.  There is also support in Pandas,
			  which has pd.read_sql and pd.to_sql for reading from databases via the
			  SQLAlchemy library.
			+ In BGS, we have a lot of data engineering task for loading data or moving
			  it between databases.  I always thought that they should just take a few
			  lines of Python, but once you have factored in preparing connection strings,
			  cursors, memory management and error handlind it ends up being much more.
			+ ETL Helper is designed to take care of those things.
			+ If you like it, please give it a star as it helps show the benefit of
			  open-sourcing our code to those in management.

...
		    </code>
		</pre>
		<aside data-markdown class="notes">
			+ This is an excerpt from the script that I used to create the
			  volcano.db file.
			+ Initially, we have to define some constants, such as the filenames
			  and the CREATE statements for the tables.
			+ Next, the meat of the process is in this simple function.
			+ After connecting to the database it uses the `exec` function to apply
			  the CREATE statements.
			+ Then we use the csv.DictReader from Python's standard library.  It reads
			  the column names and creates an iterable of dictionaries with column
			  names as keys.
			+ The `etl.load` function generates an INSERT statement from the keys and
			  loads the data.
			+ We also have to apply a transformation to the data.  We have a function
			  that takes a chunk of rows and yields them one-by-one, converting the
			  population value, which was a text string with commas as a thousands
			  separator into an integer and dropping a column that we don't need.
			+ The benefit of this approach is that the data loading pipeline is stored
			  as easy-to-read and version-control code.
			+ The simple structure of the transform function makes it easy to write
			  automated tests for, too.

			+ Thank you.
			+ For those of you who are new to SQL, I hope that you have got a taste
